Spanner is a tool for bolting containers together.

We want to be able to encapsulate the build process for a particular language or framework within a container.

There should be a relatively simple common interface to run these build processes, spanner is a tool that makes it simple to implement this interface, and do the sorts of optimisations that make builds efficient.

### Usecases
