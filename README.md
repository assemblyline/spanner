## Spanner

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/assemblyline/spanner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/assemblyline/spanner)

Spanner is a tool for bolting containers together.

We want to be able to encapsulate the build process for a particular language or framework within a container.

There should be a relatively simple common interface to run these build processes, spanner is a tool that makes it simple to implement this interface, and do the sorts of optimisations that make builds efficient.

### Usecases

You can read about the usecases we are building spanner for [here](./usecases)
